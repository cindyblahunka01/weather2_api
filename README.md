# React/Typescript Fetch Challenge
_For [EFA's](https://elevenfifty.org/) red badge course._

_This challenge must use **Typescript**._

- Create a class component and a functional component.
- The class component should reach out to the [Geolocation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API) to grab your coordinates.
- Using those coordinates, reach out to the [Open weather API](https://openweathermap.org/) and retrieve the weather information from your area.
- Once you have the weather, it should be sent to the functional component to be displayed.
